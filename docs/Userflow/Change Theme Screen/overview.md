# About

Provides a default implementation of a screen for changing the current theme settings, including Dark mode preferences and Dynamic Color if available. The screen implements all the required logic to store and restore theme settings on the device and does not require any configuration. However, both the UI and logic can be easily modified to suit any needs.
