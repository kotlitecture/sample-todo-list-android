# About

The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over a network. This approach lets your app use both network bandwidth and system resources more efficiently. The components of the Paging library are designed to fit into the recommended Android app architecture, integrate cleanly with other Jetpack components, and provide first-class Kotlin support.
